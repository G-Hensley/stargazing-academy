                        <p class="about-paragraph">We are ourselves on a mission to help people start to learn about space and explore the wonders of our vast universe.
                            You might be wondering why learning astronomy is important, well we believe that it may help us as humans reach places that we've never been before,
                            and to also broaden our imaginations. It helps us also understand our place in the universe, and just how amazing it is that we exist in this massive space.
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-paragraph">We offer an affordable solution to starting the first steps of a lifelong journey to the stars.
                            It's important that people have the oppurtinity to start out the hobby or career as something like an astrophysicist. We need people that can identify
                            threats like meteors and asteroids and possibly figure out how we can try to protect ourselves from these possible threats to life on earth.
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-paragraph">Here at stargazing academy, we hope to help you fall in love with space just as we have. It's quite awe inspiring to watch
                            meteors through a telescope, or to spot your first galaxy, nebula, or even just looking at the moon up close. Astronomy has been deeply explored for
                            thousands of years, and especially by some of the brightest minds that have existed. So we hope you can get one of our packages today, and start learning
                            and exploring our beautiful universe with us!
